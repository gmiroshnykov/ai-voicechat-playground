- Use context7 when looking up API docs
- Never use whisper-1 model
- The 'web' and 'server-go' components of this project will only ever run on localhost.
- We're using `direnv` for managing environment variables, so "public" things go into .envrc and "secret"/"private" things go into .envrc.local
- Never try to turn Node.js into a hard-real-time system. Accept that setTimeout() et al will drift and work around it with algorithms, not trying to make timers more precise.
