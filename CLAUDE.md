- See README.md for more details about this project.
- **Never try to make Node.js real-time.** Accept that setTimeout() will drift and work around it with adaptive algorithms instead of precision timing.
- **Let errors bubble up** unless you can meaningfully handle them (retries, fallbacks, adding context).
- **Avoid generic try/catch blocks** that only log errors. Either add meaningful context or let them bubble up.
- **Prefer enums/string literals over boolean variables** for configuration (e.g., `SIP_OUTBOUND_PROVIDER="kyivstar"` instead of `USE_KYIVSTAR=true`).
- Use context7 when looking up API documentation.
- Make sure all TypeScript code is properly covered by types.
- Linphone logs are available at `~/Library/Application Support/linphone/logs/linphone1.log`, but the are quite large, so if you need to inspect them - better `tail` them in a subtask.
