## FreeSWITCH VoIP Echo Service Implementation

### 2025-06-30: Initial FreeSWITCH VoIP Setup

**Objective**: Configure FreeSWITCH as a VoIP echo service that accepts incoming calls from Kyivstar's network and echoes audio back to callers.

#### Problem Analysis
- **Initial Challenge**: FreeSWITCH calls were connecting but had no audio (10-second timeout)
- **Root Cause**: NAT traversal issues - FreeSWITCH was trying to be "too smart" with STUN and external IP detection
- **Solution Approach**: Evidence-based debugging using packet capture comparison

#### Key Technical Insights

**Evidence-Based Debugging**:
- Captured Linphone packet traces to understand how successful SIP clients work with the router
- Discovered Linphone uses local IP addresses in Contact headers, not external IPs
- Router's SIP ALG (Asus RT-AX88U with SIP Passthrough) handles NAT translation automatically

**Configuration Strategy**:
```
Linphone approach: Local IP + Trust router SIP ALG
FreeSWITCH initial: External IP via STUN + Complex NAT handling  
FreeSWITCH final: Local IP + Trust router SIP ALG (mimicking Linphone)
```

#### Implementation Details

**Network Configuration** (`vars.xml`):
- Changed from STUN discovery to local IP usage:
  ```xml
  <!-- Before: -->
  <X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="stun-set" data="external_rtp_ip=stun:stun.freeswitch.org"/>
  
  <!-- After: -->
  <X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="external_rtp_ip=$${local_ip_v4}"/>
  ```

**SIP Profile** (`external.xml`):
- Configured Kyivstar gateway with TCP transport
- Enabled media bypass (let RTP flow directly, not through FreeSWITCH proxy)
- Used local IP binding to work with router's SIP ALG

**Security** (`acl.conf.xml`):
- Restricted access to Kyivstar IP range: `188.163.212.0/24`
- Maintained security while allowing legitimate provider traffic

**Dialplan** (`public.xml`):
- Routes incoming calls to echo application
- Logs call details for monitoring

#### Test Results

**✅ Successful Call Flow**:
1. **Registration**: FreeSWITCH successfully registers with Kyivstar (`REGED` status)
2. **Incoming Calls**: External calls reach FreeSWITCH successfully
3. **SIP Signaling**: Perfect negotiation with PCMA codec
4. **Audio**: Echo functionality working - callers hear their voice back
5. **RTP Flow**: Direct media path working through router NAT

**Key Success Metrics**:
- Gateway status: `REGED` and `UP`
- Call completion: Successful answer and echo
- Audio quality: Clear PCMA/8000Hz codec
- Network: Local IP addresses in all SIP headers

#### Security Implementation

**Template-Based Configuration**:
- Created `.template` versions of sensitive config files
- Added actual config files to `.gitignore`
- Documented setup process in `freeswitch/README.md`

**Git History Audit**:
- Performed comprehensive security scan of entire git history
- ✅ Confirmed no sensitive data ever committed
- Repository safe for public use

#### Files Created/Modified

**Configuration Templates** (safe for public repo):
- `freeswitch/conf/sip_profiles/external.xml.template`
- `freeswitch/conf/dialplan/public.xml.template`

**Documentation**:
- `freeswitch/README.md` - Complete setup instructions
- Updated `.gitignore` - Protects sensitive files

**Core Configuration**:
- `freeswitch/conf/vars.xml` - Network settings (local IP approach)
- `freeswitch/conf/autoload_configs/acl.conf.xml` - Security rules

#### Architecture Decisions

**NAT Traversal Strategy**:
- **Rejected**: Complex FreeSWITCH NAT detection, STUN, aggressive NAT handling
- **Adopted**: Simple local IP binding + router SIP ALG trust
- **Rationale**: Match proven working approach from Linphone

**Media Handling**:
- **Mode**: Bypass media (direct RTP flow)
- **Benefits**: Lower latency, reduced FreeSWITCH load, simpler debugging
- **Trade-offs**: Less control over media stream, relies on router capabilities

**Security Approach**:
- **Template system**: Separates configuration structure from sensitive data
- **IP-based ACLs**: Restrict access to known provider networks
- **Git hygiene**: Ensure no secrets in version control history

#### Next Steps / Future Enhancements

**Potential Improvements**:
1. **Multi-provider support**: Template system supports easy addition of other SIP providers
2. **Advanced dialplan**: Route different numbers to different applications
3. **Call recording**: Add recording capabilities for specific use cases
4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging and metrics collection
5. **Failover**: Multiple provider registration for redundancy

**Integration Opportunities**:
1. **Go service integration**: Route calls to Go-based voice chat application
2. **Web interface**: Real-time call monitoring dashboard
3. **API integration**: Connect to external services for advanced call handling

#### Lessons Learned

**Evidence-Based Debugging**:
- Packet captures provide definitive answers about network behavior
- Comparing working vs non-working implementations is highly effective
- Router/network equipment behavior significantly impacts VoIP success

**FreeSWITCH Philosophy**:
- "Simple and working" often beats "complex and theoretically better"
- Trust existing working network infrastructure (like router SIP ALG)
- Media bypass can solve many NAT-related issues

**Security in Open Source**:
- Template-based configuration enables secure open-source sharing
- Git history auditing is crucial for public repositories
- Clear documentation prevents security mistakes during setup
